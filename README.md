# Raytracer

### Overview
This project is an attempt at making a simple raytracer built from the ground up in rust.
I am currently following a walkthrough that covers all the fundamentals of how raytracing
works at its core and implementing it in rust.

## How to use
In order to get an image out of the raytracer, as of now, you will need to build the project
into an executable and then run the program in terminal with the out put being piped into
a ```.ppm``` file.

Ex.
```bash
 ./Raytracer.exe > image.ppm
```
